communication complexity.
$n$ at most: exchange everything.

space bounded version ignored 30 years.

e.g, Equality. Inner Product on GF(2).
EQ, no memory needed.
IP, 1 bit.

communication matrix.
rectangle partition/cover/overlay.

overlay fully characterizes memoryless complexity.
overlay is poly-logarithmic.
