## Background

   * micro-wave: `< 3GHz`. Used in 1G to 4G cellular network. 
   * millimeter wave (mmWave): `28 GHz -- 300 GHz`. Proposed to used in 5G. 
   
Frequency high; wavelength small; energy captured by receiver low; SNR low. 

**analogy beamforming** (?)

**precoding** (?)

## Measurement

Result:

   * LOS (Line-Of-Sight): fading exponent = 2, near performance in free space. 
   * NLOS: reflection actually increases coverage. exponent ~ 4. 
   
Methodology:

   * **Stochastic geometry** -- model SINR distribution. 
   * **Poisson Point Process** -- model BS. 
   * **Random Shape Theory** -- model buildings.
