I was originally responsible for MCC and later transferred to SDN Tutorial.

The tutorial is given by:
<http://www.sdnacademy.net/>

The materials are well organized.
Hands-on exercises are included.
Participants can practice view `mininet`, a simulation platform run in Virtual Box's VM.
Tutorials are included in form of wiki pages.
It's also good material for self-learning.

SDN:

   * Switch: not only L2 switch;
   can be L3 and even higher.
   In SDN model, all forwarding devices are abstracted as "switch".
   * Controller:
   The centralized part to control the whole system;
   the place to accommodate most research works.
   Southbound protocol: talking with switches.
   OpenFlow is a southbound protocol.
   Northbound protocol: talking with applications.
   * Application.
   e.g. measurement, ACL, routing information, etc.

The essence of SDN:
think of application instead of protocol.
Just program the logic into the controller.
Do not worry about how controller communicates with switches and manifests the rules.
