I did not take away much information from this talk.. Really lack background. 

A show of tag cloud of recent communication research works. "channel" and "interference" stand out, very big. 

When theory and practice diverge:

   * Some works show that cooperation can improve the efficiency when exposed to interference. e.g. a 2-by-2 setting. the signal from the other transmitter is useless: interference. However, the transmitters and receivers and collaborate; send to both; decode together; gain. (like MIMO?)
   * Original research asserted high improvement, e.g. 100%. 
   * With more practical experiment, the number is reduced. 
   * Huawei, last month, 8%….
   
**DoF** (degree of freedom). What's that in communication?…
