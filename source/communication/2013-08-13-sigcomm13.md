   * GENI Design Principles
   * PlanetLab Policy Considerations
   * PlanetLab Design Principles

"Zen and Art of the network architecture"

"Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
-- Robert Pirsig

Classic view.

Romantic view.

Those who want to fix the Motorcycle
v.s.
Those who want to ride it.

### GENI.

Duality. Networking v.s. distributed systems.

### PlanetLab & CoBlitz

   * Anlyais.
   * Controlled lab: Implemetation Reality
   * Deployment: Traffic & user Reality
   * Pilot demo: Customer Reality
   * Commercial adoption: Market Reality. sold to Telcos
   * Change the market.

Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

### Path to Enlightenment

Assumptions hide the truth.

Users reveal hidden assumptions.

Operationalize -- New Bar.

represents the fixed-point of an architecture.
[Perterson, 2006], 13 design invariants to guide evolution.

Circa 2013. (Django Object Class Definition)

### Lessons

   * Whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
   * Unifying abstractions.
   * Balance requirements.
   * Experience (reality) driven.
   Deploy it, operationalize it, use it.
   * Dynamicity is the reality.

SDN: separate control and data plane.

Network Function Virtualization:
data plane functions running in VMs on commodity machine.

Internet -- Big switch.

Everything as a service. XaaS.

XaaS Operating System (XOS)

### Example

CoBlitz, operator CDN, now Akamai

Syndicate.

## B4: Experience with a Globally-Deployed Software Deﬁned WAN

SD WAN.

2010 traffic, the 2nd largest ISP if it were.

### Principles

   * separate forwarding from control
   * whole network as a single fabric
   * logically centrlaized
   * deterministic

### Implementation

Site -- site, iBGP.
site -- cluster, eBGP.

Guagga: ISIS, BGP

Paxos

OFC, OFA

### Traffic Engineering

Max-min fair bandwidth allocation to FlowGroup.

Throughput increase compared with shortest path routing.

main benefits come from reduced provisioning for fault tolerance

### B4 WAN

### SDN Benefits

   * commodity forwarding hardware
   * global optimization
   * network as a fabric rather than a collection of individual boxes
   * TE and edge rate limiting

## Achieving High Utilization with Software-Driven WAN

Chi-Yao Hong (UIUC)

Inter-DC WAN

Inefficiency:

   * Lack of coordination.
   background.
   can shape the traffic.
   * MPLS-TE chooses shortest path.
   (can do non-SP routing?)

SWAN (Software-Driven WAN)

Theoretical bounds compared with MaxMinFairShare

Congestion-free update is hard.
Sometimes no feasible solution.

   * With slack, can guarantee to find the solution.
   * an optimization formulation.
   Determine demand-path-step variables.

OF OpenFlow.

20K rules. with OF, 1-2K rules.

## Ambient Backscatter: Wireless Communication Out of Thin Air

Vincent Liu

noise:

   * Analog low-pass filter

distributed MAC:

   * Backscatter device do not have energy levels.
   * no Backscatter, see all 0s or 1s.
   * with Backscatter, transitions.
   * Use bit-transitions as proxy for energy levels

Applications:

   * Grocery, warehouse.
   Items can figure out whether they are misplaced on their own.

Battery-free hardware prototype.
Transform existing signals to both power source and communication medium.

## Dude, Where’s My Card? RFID Positioning That Works with Multipath and Non-Line of Sight

Jue Wang and Dina Katabi

Dina MIT,

http://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/

Battery-free tags, 5-cent

Locate tags. 10 to 15 cm accuracy.

   * Previous models require Line-Of-Sight (LOS).
   * accuracy is about half a meter.

Challenge:

   * Multipath effects.
   * RSSI, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA).
   * Angle does not reflect the direction of the object.
   * RSSI does not reflect distance well.

Key ideas:

   * **Focus on proximity to reference RFIDs**
   * Exploit multipath
   * Nearby RFIDs propagate along closer paths.

Power of reflection.
Multipath profiles.

An antenna array to capture multiple profiles.
However, it's expensive.

**Use single sliding antenna to mimic an array.**

Detect proximity from multipath profiles.

   * Naive, correlation, not working well.

Borrow from speech recognition:

   * Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
   * Computes the total Warp to change from signal 1 to signal 2.

Implement Pinlt Reader on USRP.

PINIT

   * 10x improve to RSSI
   * 6x improve to AoA.

## Dhwani: Secure Peer-to-Peer Acoustic NFC

NFC standards does not define security the physical layer.

Acoustic Communications.

Use speaker and microphone

3 Challenges correspond to the RF counterparts.

Software defined acoustic OFDM

Dhwani

JamSecure

self interference cancellation.

Conclusions:

   * Enable NFC in today's device.
   * Software-only solution.

## See Through Walls with Wi-Fi!

Fadel Adib and Dina Katabi

Challenges: Wall reflection is 10K stronger than reflections coming from behind the wall.

Wi-Vi.
http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/wivi/

Poster: http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/papers/wivi-poster.pdf

Idea: transmit two waves and cancel each other for static objects.

   * Three antennas
   * Two transmit
   * One receive

Motion:

   * tracking motion: antenna array.
   * Human motion emulates antenna array.

Gesture encoding: a transition codec.

One person per curvy line.
Automatic estimation of number of people.
Classification.
