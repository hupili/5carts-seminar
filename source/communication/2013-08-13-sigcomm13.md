"Zen and Art of the network architecture"

"Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
-- Robert Pirsig

Classic view.

Romantic view.

Those who want to fix the Motorcycle
v.s.
Those who want to ride it.

### GENI.

Duality. Networking v.s. distributed systems.

### PlanetLab & CoBlitz

   * Anlyais.
   * Controlled lab: Implemetation Reality
   * Deployment: Traffic & user Reality
   * Pilot demo: Customer Reality
   * Commercial adoption: Market Reality. sold to Telcos
   * Change the market.

Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

### Path to Enlightenment

Assumptions hide the truth.

Users reveal hidden assumptions.

Operationalize -- New Bar.

represents the fixed-point of an architecture.
[Perterson, 2006], 13 design invariants to guide evolution.

Circa 2013. (Django Object Class Definition)

### Lessons

   * Whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
   * Unifying abstractions.
   * Balance requirements.
   * Experience (reality) driven.
   Deploy it, operationalize it, use it.
   * Dynamicity is the reality.

SDN: separate control and data plane.

Network Function Virtualization:
data plane functions running in VMs on commodity machine.

Internet -- Big switch.

Everything as a service. XaaS.

XaaS Operating System (XOS)

### Example

CoBlitz, operator CDN, now Akamai

Syndicate.
