### P: Collision-driven Physical-layer Identification of RFID UHF Tags

identification can be done with only phy-layer characteristics.

future: there is no need to put ID in RFID anymore..?
Give each tag more drastically different hardware, use that as the ID.

Decoding (fingerprinting) complexity?

### P: Rethinking Congestion Control in Virtualized Datacenters

identification of the new problem when VM is used.

TCP incast: multiple TCP on a physical link;
backoff leads to inefficient use of hardware capacity.

TCP relies on RTT to estimate the congestion level.

Prior works: adjust RTO; monotonic, the smaller the better.

TCP in VM:
due to VM scheduling, extra delay is caused;
TCP backoffs too much;
need to estimate real network incurred delay.

implementation based on Xeon.

Linux process scheduling delay, less than 1ms.

Commercial VM software, e.g. VMWare, usually 30ms to 60 ms delay between VMs.

The extra delay on co-existing virtualizations, e.g. LXC?

Other adjustable parameters? e.g. buffer size.

give adjust formula by reasoning and show improvement by simulation.

future: solve the incast problem from upper layer?
current landscape: solve in lower-layer;
even below TCP;
e.g. the explicit congestion notification (ECN).
some specific app like map-reduce can potentially be adjusted in the framework to alleviate incast problem.

### P: Software Defined Live Virtual Machine Migration

Current landscape:
intra-LAN migration is well solved;
inter-LAN migration a few;
inter- data-center migration, none.

intra-LAN migration:
essentially the problem of VM copying;
switches can re-learn the new filtering table.

inter-LAN migration:
it takes longer time for routers to converge.
Leverage the capability of SDN: centralized reconfigure; converge faster.

the application of inter- data-center migration is not very clear.

VM copying is a hard problem because we want to reduce service down-time.
Current popular approach already in commercial use:
incremental copy:

   * Old VM serves.
   * Copy memory image and related states to new VM.
   * Old VM changes during the copying.
   * Incrementally copy the chnages.
   * Loop several times until the difference is small.
   Then close old VM; copy rest difference; start new VM.

### P: Efficient Verification of Network Reachability Properties

the encoding of packet set to atom predicate for fast query.

The mapping is data-independent.

Some previous approaches from the SDN tutorial on Sigcomm13:
1) collect the network configuration and simulate whether a packet can pass;
2) the space splitting approach to calculate reachability sets.

Input: two ports (on device)

Evaluation on query time. Pre-processing time is not included.
Both the work and previous counterparts have small pre-processing time.

### P: Link Quality Aware Geographical Routing in Hybrid Cognitive Radio Mesh Networks

Can be used as the communication layer of DSN.

Proposal stage. Implementation just started.

Exists some geo-location lookup service.

mesh network: has certain infrastructure.
i.e. some nodes have fixed position, adequate energy and bandwidth, etc.

ad hoc network: infrastructure-less

traditional DTN: only selects next-hop.

cognitive radio ingredient: need to select the channel.
