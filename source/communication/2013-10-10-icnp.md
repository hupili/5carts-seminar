## A Uniﬁed Framework for Line-like Skeleton Extraction in 2D/3D Sensor Networks

Liu Fangming

## DOF: Duplicate Detectable Opportunistic Forwarding in Duty-Cycled Wireless Sensor Networks

CitySee, a real sensor network.

low duty-cycled sensor network.

X-MAC:

   * wake-up and see if there is anything
   * send until ACK is heard

Opportunistic forwarding

use time slot to distinguish ACK from different potential forwarders.

## Pathﬁnder: Robust Path Reconstruction in Large Scale Sensor Networks with Lossy Links

Yi Gao

many sensors and single sink.
reconstruct paths at sink.

PAD, PathZip, MNT

node-side recording

path bit vector, path container

X. Mao, X. Miao, Y. He, T. Zhu, J. Wang, W. Dong, X. Li, and Y. Liu,
“Citysee: Urban CO2 monitoring with sensors,” in Proceedings of INFOCOM, 2012.

MNT is a key competitor.

Use one reference packets instead of a set of helper packets.

## Joint Aggregation and MAC Design to Prolong Sensor Network Lifetime

ns-2, TinyOS

adjust the lifetime tradeoff between sender and receiver.
parameter receiver's Tr value: the duty-cycle.

aggregation: computation in networks and reduce transmission.
e.g. the highest temperature.
intermediate node: hold data for a while.

lifetime balance: hold data for longer time if battery is lower

most existing duty-cycling MAC protocols do not bound end-to-end delay

split delay budget into: Forwarding Aggregation Delay (FAD) and Tr

children and parent (next-hop on the forwarding tree) nodes

## Power-Aware Design of IP Core Networks under General Trafﬁc Demands

Zhi Zhang

PoP.

green net. : dynamic power scaling and smart stand-by.

correlated traffic and uncorrelated traffic.

reduce power consumption by change topology.

chassis, can be active or inactive, whether having traffic or not

P=2, perfect weighted matching.
iterative matching.
P/2 approximation.

disjoint set cover.

simulation.

## Real-Time Power Control for Dynamic Optical Networks – Algorithms and Experimentation

optical net.
device dynamic.
network static.

BER is a convex func. with power.
shape unknown, depends on multiple factors.

SLA requirements more important than optimality

## Energy Efﬁcient Carrier Aggregation Algorithms for Next Generation Cellular Networks

## CMES: Collaborative Energy Save for MIMO 802.11 Wireless Networks

MIMO 802.11

59% less battery lifetime than legacy wifi

MIMO idle power GT SISO active power.

metric: power/ goodput (joule/ bit)

one-sided energy management: receiver optimal.

informed walk over MIMO modes.

## Hop-by-hop Computing for Green Internet Routing

Dan Wang

Cisco CRS-1, 1MW, 10K times of a PC

TCAM: key energy consumption of a router

past approaches: turn routers/ net. devices into sleep mode.
topology is pruned.

observation: different traffic volumes influence energy.

trunking, 802.1AX

power model.
similar to a step function.
BitEngine 12000 to validate.

Routing Algebra, Infocomm'01, Sobrinho,
some properties for loop avoidance.
left-isotonic

Not all ISP like MPLS, e.g. China Research Net.

future: centralized optimization and use MPLS to implement.
