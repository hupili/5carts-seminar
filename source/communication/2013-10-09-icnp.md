## Using Routers to Build Logic Circuits: How Powerful is BGP?

NOT gadget

infinite BGP network, turing complete

Gao-Rexford condition

relation between BGP dynamics and logic circuts

PSPACE-hardness

start from constructing logic gates.

## Optimal Link-state Hop-by-hop Routing

shortest path routing now, problem to balance load.

   * link-state: every router views the whole network status.
   * hop-by-hop
   * adaptive: do not rely on traffic matrix to adjust the weights.
   * optimal w.r.t. some objective.

prior: MPLS, Penalizing Exponential Flow Splitting, distance-vector (not link-state), source-routing,

multi-commodity flow.

HALO

compatible with current routers and SDN.

[1] M/M/1 delay formula for cost

## STRIP: Privacy-Preserving Vector-Based Routing

Wilko Henecka

PRISM

BGP: information hiding protocol. not enough.
can infer properties, e.g. cut-prov relation.

homomorphic encryption.

secure sum

distance-vector. distributed Bellman-Ford.

idea: encrypt at one node,
ask the potential next-hops to compute whether it lies on the SP or not;
hop by hop until reaching destination;
destination finally computes the distance and send back to source.

future: our CD work can also use homomorphic encryption;
though, DH is still a good starting point;
the SP calculation can be used as a kind of graph distance.

some pointers to useful libs in Python for number manipulation.

## Graceful Router Updates in Link-State Protocols

current: OSPF/ IS-IS + MPLS + LDP.

transient loops: do not know the order of updates.

idea: split updates to a sequence of loop-free updates.
i.e. gradually increase link weights.

node shutdown.
simple solution: shutdown link one by one, not effective.
better: OSPF/ IS-IS existing feature, simultaneous weights update.

multi-dimensional updates

[7] ToN, the single link updates.

minimal sequence of updates; polytime algo;

## Networking Cloud Data Centers: Providing Dependable Storage and Computation

Keynote 2: K. K. Ramakrishnan (AT&T Labs-Research, USA)

virtualization: key.

Acme LAN

VPN: MPLS L2/L3 VPN from providers.

L2-VPN (VPLS) make WAN like a LAN. 
LAN-based VM migration is possible.

CloudNet allows seamless migration from enterprise DC to cloud DC.

RipeCloud. Disaster recovery.
sync, async, piplined-sync.
treat VM as black box. 
hypervisor intercepts disk I/O and network I/O.
client gets safe reply.
recover to EC2 within 2min.

Yank.
transient server.

Remus, snapshot manager in Xen.

## Panel (and next ICNP announcement)

Panel moderator: Ken Calvert (University of Kentucky)

a new ACM conference on ICN, Sept, 2014

CCN

future Internet: NDN, PSIRP/ PURSUIT, SAIL

key: many-to-many; producer-consumer pattern.

important concepts: Rendezvous? Naming? Caching?

tech push; business pull?

1993 ICNP.
http://www.ieee-icnp.org/1993/icnp1993-program.html

disaster notification:
disseminate info.;
safety notification.
pub/sub capability of CCN.
Twitter like pub/sub: useful not scale; rely on frequent poll; closed system.
[future] the objective aligns with DSN,
one from networking, one from application, should merge at some point.

ICN.
different mindsets: academic (big picture); startup (details, pains, get acquired).
different granularity of "content", e.g. file block, BT chunk, etc.
small view, reality, win in short term, compatibility issue, similar history (NAT, IPSec, BGP).
challenges: 
data(block) persistence; 
unifying naming conventions (backward compatibility); 
pricing/ charging (this killed multi-cast).

ICN: multicast with caching?
INFOCOMM'98, Lehman, active reliable multicast.
market-pull: first overlay CDN; then network-operator CDNs.
efficiency will increase but it's not the only goal, consider economics.

Lixia.
IP initial: so much overhead?
NDN concepts: still hourglass arch; change from IP to other thing.
91', "as long as you carry IP packet, it does not matter what's underlying"
-- lesson: NDN over IP.
NDN independent of IP, make use of IP.
TCP/ IP: thin waist; end-to-end principles.
lessons: design into waist directly -- security; congestion.
driving force: "some people are afraid of being left behind".
"how to reach that box?"
