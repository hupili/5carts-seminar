## Mosaic: Quantifying Privacy Leakage in Mobile Networks

Infer user information as much as possible from packet trace.

   * User
   * Session

Communication spread on multiple IPs (from mobility between ISPs).

Cellular service provider (CSP) or an Internet service provider (ISP)

Session according to flow tuple.

Ground truth: RADIUS

Tessellation

Main approaches:

   * OSN ID
   * traffic marker
   * activity fingerprint

OSN ID as anchors:
URL, cookies, header.
coverage too small, 2.3% (FB+Twitter?).

traffic markers:

   * Google doc, uniqueness = 1, persistency ~ 1
   * ...

Traffic attribution.

Activity fingerprint:

   * Top k DNS names.
   * mobile users can be identified by their favourite services.

Mosaic, 12 classes.

   * From user profiles
   * From device

Information leaked from profiles and network trace can supplement each other.

## Expressive Privacy Control with Pseudonyms

Seungyeop Han

Trackers link user information to form large profiles.

some pros for tracking?
personalization, security, revenue of service.

Goal: give users control of how they are tracked.

Current defense for tracking:

   * 3rd party cookie blocking.
   * DoNoTrack
   * Tor, proxies

Relate IDs:

   * cookie, JS localstorage, flash

Create a set of pseudonyms.
Users choose one from them for communication.

Design:

   * IPv6 allows many IPs per host.
   * Fix network prefix, use whatever host part as they want.
   * Use symmetric key to encrypt host part.

Implementation:

   * Policy engine as Chrome plugin.
   * IPv6 tunnel broker -- get a /64 network.

## Towards Efﬁcient Trafﬁc-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks

Stevens Le Blond

IP anonymity

ingress + egress: can get info. from the time series.

Problem: Onion routing does not resist traffic analysis.
well-known.

Anonymous Quanta:

   * k-anonymity: indistinguishable among k clients.

Threat model:

   * global passive (traffic analysis) attack.
   * active attack
   * edge mix

Constant rate. strawman.

Padding at the core:

   * Padding.
   Ideal: all pairs; but not practical.
   * Split traffic in the core.

Padding at the edges:

   * k-anonymity set (kset)
   * correlate k clients for rate change

Month-long BitTorrent trace with 100K users.

Compare with: Constant, Broadcast, P2P, etc.
Aqua has higher bandwidth efficiency.

## SplitX: High-Performance Private Analytics

Ruichuan Chen

Each user should maintain their data locally.

Make aggregated queries in distributed users private data storage
while preserving the privacy.

differential privacy.
add noise to preserve privacy.

CCS, NDSS

Components:

   * Analyst, assumed be malicious, want to find privacy of users.
   * Users, hold the data, also malicious, want to find the analyze result.
   * Servers, honest but curious.
   1 aggregator and 2 mixers.

**XOR** encryption. -- high performance

answer pollution protect -- **bucket**. e.g. age range.

mix knows what query ID the users answered:
double-split.

duplicated answer: triple splitting.

## Participatory Networking: An API for Application Control of SDNs

Applications:

   * SSHGuard, SSHGuard is a popular tool to detect brute-force attacks via log
   monitoring and install local ﬁrewall rules (e.g., via iptables) in
   response
   * Ekiga, an open source video conferencing application
   * ZooKeeper, a coordination service for distributed systems used by Twitter, Netﬂix, and Yahoo!
   * Hadoop

decompose control and visibility

resolve conflicts between requests

PANE: logical central controller.

   * requests
   * hints
   * queries

Share: principals, privilege

share tree.

PANE uses OpenFlow to manifest the allocation.

## Developing a Predictive Model of Quality of Experience for Internet Video

QoE model.

objective: peak signal-to-noise-ratio.

subjective: mean opinion score.

engagement: e.g. fraction of video viewed.

Quality metrics:

   * join time.
   * buffering ratio
   * rate of buffering
   * rate of switching
   * bitrate

non-monotonic, e.g. avg. bitrate.

confounding factors:

   * type of video: Live and VoD have different viewing patterns.
   * connectivity, e.g. DSL, wireless.

Complex relationship. Use machine learning.
decision tree is the best.

test potential factors:

   * relative information gain
   * decision tree structure
   * tolerance level

split

final: a collection of decision trees. 70% accuracy.

## ElasticSwitch: Practical Work-Conserving Bandwidth Guarantees for Cloud Computing

ElasticSwitch (ES)

tenant

Goal:

   * min bandwidth guarantee: **Hose model**
   * work-conserving allocation
   * practical: .

ES runs in hypervisor

turns hose model into VM-to-VM pip guarantees

## Full Duplex Radios

Andrea Goldsmith. "Wireless Communications"
-- generally not possible to do full duplex because of self-interference.

Just subtract it?

transmit and receive, see some harmonics.

   * spectrum resue. micro, pico, etc, ...
   increase deployment complexity.

> Datacenter networking is currently dominated by two major
> trends. One aims toward lossless,
> at layer-2 fabrics based
> on Converged Enhanced Ethernet or InfiniBand, with benefits in enciency and performance. The other targets
> exibility based on Software Defined Networking, which enables
> Overlay Virtual Networking

## pFabric: Minimal Near-Optimal Datacenter Transport

Mohammad Alizadeh

Gaol: complete flows quickly.

FCT: Flow-Completion-Time

Prior work: use rate control to schedule flows.
e.g. DCTCP, HULL, D2TCP, D3, PDQ.

pFabric:

   * Packets carry a single priority. e.g. remaining flow size.
   * pFabric switches: small buffer; send highest priority; drop lowest priority.
   * host: less rate control as possible.
   only to avoid congestion collapse.

[Bar-Noy], NP-hard for ideal flow scheduling:

   * greedy algo. -- 2-approximation.

pFabric, try to mimic the behaviour distributedly.

Key: decouple flow scheduling (switch) from rate control (host).

min-TCP:

   * start at line-rate
   * no retransmission. just reduce window if packet is dropped.
   * slow increase (like TCP)

clean-slate approach: require new switches and minor host changes.

## Integrating Microsecond Circuit Switching into the Data Center

scale-out networks:

   * no/ little oversubscription.
   * multiple layers.

replace layers of switch to reconfigurable point-to-point switches.

Mordia OCS model.

Use 3D MEMS.
