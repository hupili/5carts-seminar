## Mosaic: Quantifying Privacy Leakage in Mobile Networks

Infer user information as much as possible from packet trace.

   * User
   * Session

Communication spread on multiple IPs (from mobility between ISPs).

Cellular service provider (CSP) or an Internet service provider (ISP)

Session according to flow tuple.

Ground truth: RADIUS

Tessellation

Main approaches:

   * OSN ID
   * traffic marker
   * activity fingerprint

OSN ID as anchors:
URL, cookies, header.
coverage too small, 2.3% (FB+Twitter?).

traffic markers:

   * Google doc, uniqueness = 1, persistency ~ 1
   * ...

Traffic attribution.

Activity fingerprint:

   * Top k DNS names.
   * mobile users can be identified by their favourite services.

Mosaic, 12 classes.

   * From user profiles
   * From device

Information leaked from profiles and network trace can supplement each other.

## Expressive Privacy Control with Pseudonyms

Seungyeop Han

Trackers link user information to form large profiles.

some pros for tracking?
personalization, security, revenue of service.

Goal: give users control of how they are tracked.

Current defense for tracking:

   * 3rd party cookie blocking.
   * DoNoTrack
   * Tor, proxies

Relate IDs:

   * cookie, JS localstorage, flash

Create a set of pseudonyms.
Users choose one from them for communication.

Design:

   * IPv6 allows many IPs per host.
   * Fix network prefix, use whatever host part as they want.
   * Use symmetric key to encrypt host part.

Implementation:

   * Policy engine as Chrome plugin.
   * IPv6 tunnel broker -- get a /64 network.

## Towards Efﬁcient Trafﬁc-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks

Stevens Le Blond

IP anonymity

ingress + egress: can get info. from the time series.

Problem: Onion routing does not resist traffic analysis.
well-known.

Anonymous Quanta:

   * k-anonymity: indistinguishable among k clients.

Threat model:

   * global passive (traffic analysis) attack.
   * active attack
   * edge mix

Constant rate. strawman.

Padding at the core:

   * Padding.
   Ideal: all pairs; but not practical.
   * Split traffic in the core.

Padding at the edges:

   * k-anonymity set (kset)
   * correlate k clients for rate change

Month-long BitTorrent trace with 100K users.

Compare with: Constant, Broadcast, P2P, etc.
Aqua has higher bandwidth efficiency.

## SplitX: High-Performance Private Analytics

Ruichuan Chen

Each user should maintain their data locally.

Make aggregated queries in distributed users private data storage
while preserving the privacy.

differential privacy.
add noise to preserve privacy.

CCS, NDSS

Components:

   * Analyst, assumed be malicious, want to find privacy of users.
   * Users, hold the data, also malicious, want to find the analyze result.
   * Servers, honest but curious.
   1 aggregator and 2 mixers.

**XOR** encryption. -- high performance

answer pollution protect -- **bucket**. e.g. age range.

mix knows what query ID the users answered:
double-split.

duplicated answer: triple splitting.
