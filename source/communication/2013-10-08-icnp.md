## Key Notes

Keynote 1: Anja Feldmann (Deutsche Telekom Labs/TU Berlin, Germany)
Session chair: Volker Hilt (Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent)

mental map of Internet

NAP

IXP. carrier neutral places.
essentially L2 switches.

public peering. private peering.

DE-CIX. 500 members now, 5 locations in Frankfurt

2011, ~350 IXPs worldwide.

collaboration with a major European IXP.
peta bytes per hour.
sFlow. sampling 1 out of 16K. 

quantify the accuracy of the statistics after sampling?

application classification.
limitation of sFlow: 1/16K sample; 128 Bytes data.

IMC'13, using large IXP as vantage points.

organizations having no ASes but many servers can shape the traffic.
end of AS-level view.

peering ratio GT 60%.
this talk 2012, 200K peerings at one single point.

70% peerings are invisible with all pub data sets.

   * Flatter view on IXP than thought.
   * AS view outdated; use organization view.
   * peering + cust-prov view should fade.

## Tailoring End-to-End IP Security Protocols to the Internet of Things

Rene Hummen

Prior:

   * minimal DTLS
   * HIP Diet Exchange (DEX)
   * Minimal IKEv2

pub-key operation overhead too high.

never close sessions: pub-key once.

session resumption.
for HIP DEX protocol.

challenges of pub-key in IoT scenario.

> First, public- key operations require significant resources from a constrained device. Hence, a full handshake should only be performed infrequently. Second, expensive public-key-based operations aggravate the risk of DoS attacks against constrained devices, even with a single, unconstrained adversary. Thus, DoS pro- tection mechanisms for the IoT must account for resource heterogeneity. Third, retransmission strategies have to account for both, varying processing times of handshake messages and high packet loss in constrained wireless networks.

address DoS: responder uses a window; 
under threshold, simple puzzle; 
above threshold, difficult puzzle.

## A Few Bits Are Enough - ASIC Friendly Regular Expression Matching for High Speed Network Security Systems

Alex X. Liu

Deep Packet Inspection

past: string matching.

current: RegEx.
e.g. SNORT

prior works:

   * DFA: best speed, worst memory (can be exponential).
   * NFA, reverse.
   * XFA. 
   associate a piece of programm with each state.
   balance. not practical, esp. for ASIC.

HASIC. History-based FA.

only three instructions: test, set, clear

HFA: DFA+a vector of bits.

bit vector compactly represent partial matches.

## Who are You Talking to? Breaching Privacy in Encrypted IM Networks

Alex X. Liu

arch: everyone talks with IM relay server.

misconception: only server knows content and links.

link privacy revealed without server's help.

input: passively observed traffic; IP of a user 

output: top-k users the given user communicate

1st work for breaking IM communication privacy.

wavelet. COLD.
computes the correlation between wavelet coefficients.

size v.s. time. discrete wavelet. 
Haar wv func.
C&W Shannon based method to choose decomposition levels.

Yahoo Messenger.

future: relation to the WWW2012 information transfer paper?
"Information Transfer in Social Media".
All only use time sequence information.

future: use some smoother for two sequences before calculating correlation.
same effect as spectrum analysis and then use the low-frequency component.

Time Sequence Correlation (TSC) does not work:
randomly delay at relay server.

## GenePrint: Generic and Accurate Physical-Layer Identiﬁcation for UHF RFID Tags

Dan Ma

what they hold. what they are.

imperfections in HW, fingerprint.

state-of-the-art: MobiCom2010, D. Zanetti. TIE

Zanetti, Davide, and Boris Danev. "Physical-layer identification of UHF RFID tags." Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking. ACM, 2010. APA 

P=C+f+n

   * C: constant
   * f: feature
   * n: noise

cov(P1,P2)=cov(f1,f2)

RN16

64-pulses: each pair a feature. F.

Equi-width histogram to estimate F's distribution.

future:
use the reader to tap the physical identity of walk-by tags.
without knowing the protocol, we can identify tags.


## Mitigating Malicious Interference via Subcarrier-Level Radio Agility in Wireless Networks

Shailendra Singh

jam attack. easy, commercial software available.

previous, Frequency Hopping, DSS, etc.

## Optimal Multipath Congestion Control and Request Forwarding in Information-Centric Networks

Content Store

Pending Interest Table

Forwarding Information Base

## Optimal Cache Allocation for Content-Centric Networking

CCN

web proxy, e.g. squid. client-side cache.

reverse proxy, cache at server side.

sigcomm12, more cache at edge.

sigcomm13, cache at edge is enough.

## Let’s ChronoSync: Decentralized Dataset State Synchronization in Named Data Networking

P2P, topology mismatch.

NDN

## Joint-Family: Enabling Adaptive Bitrate Streaming in Peer-to-Peer Video-on-Demand

Dan Rubenstein

ABR. adaptive bit rate.

TFT works best for Rarest First chunk selection.

## PVTCP: Towards Practical and Effective Congestion Control in Virtualized Datacenters

Xen

VM scheduling delay.

incast. scatter-gather.

sigmetrics'09, reduce RTO is effective.

## Dynamic Distributed Algorithm for Computing Multiple Next-Hops on a Tree

intra-domain routing.
get full topology and compute SPT.

multi-path: for resilience

tree based link-state

every node maintains a tree

## Selective Data Replication for Online Social Networks with Distributed Datacenters

SD3

PlanetLab

FB current: each data center has full replica;
single master replication, i.e. every slave pushes to master and master then pushes to other slaves.

geo-location aware mapping of users to DCs.

sigcomm'10 paper, collecting data of users and their friends in the same DC.

P2P and cloud replication not work because interaction is not considered.

friendship does not mean high interaction rate.

atomized data replication.
avoid replicate frequently updated but infrequently visited data.

future:
the atomized data replication argument is
similar to our pull/ push channel model analysis.

the current FB model?

SPAR (Sigcomm'10) and RS

> any measurement showing that FB is replicating data to geo-distributed DCs?

## Falloc: Fair Network Bandwidth Allocation in IaaS Datacenters via a Bargaining Game Approach

Fangmin Liu

current IaaS, pay per usage only for CPU, mem, and storage.

network resources are shared on a best effort manner.

pure theoretical analysis.
incremental: SDN implementation.

## Posters

### On The Effectiveness of Sybil Defenses Based on Online Social Networks

sigcomm10 paper, community detection and sybil detection are the same problem.

tried prior works 900K node FB graph.
Inject sybil nodes, find that none works.

some data pointers, e.g. 90% users accept sybil friend request directly.
sybils on average have 150 friends, (a study on Renren).

http://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~dkoll/

some DSN works.

### Modeling, Identifying, and Simulating Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP

DASH

distinguish DASH traffic from non-DASH traffic

only packet headers are available

The key feature is the inbound/ outbound data rate.

adudump, some tool like tcpdump from previous works.
Can do other applications than HTTP.

currently DASH are widely deployed.
e.g. 30% residential traffic is netflix and netflix uses DASH.
