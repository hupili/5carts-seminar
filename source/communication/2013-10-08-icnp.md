## Key Notes

Keynote 1: Anja Feldmann (Deutsche Telekom Labs/TU Berlin, Germany)
Session chair: Volker Hilt (Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent)

mental map of Internet

NAP

IXP. carrier neutral places.
essentially L2 switches.

public peering. private peering.

DE-CIX. 500 members now, 5 locations in Frankfurt

2011, ~350 IXPs worldwide.

collaboration with a major European IXP.
peta bytes per hour.
sFlow. sampling 1 out of 16K. 

quantify the accuracy of the statistics after sampling?

application classification.
limitation of sFlow: 1/16K sample; 128 Bytes data.

IMC'13, using large IXP as vantage points.

organizations having no ASes but many servers can shape the traffic.
end of AS-level view.

peering ratio GT 60%.
this talk 2012, 200K peerings at one single point.

70% peerings are invisible with all pub data sets.

   * Flatter view on IXP than thought.
   * AS view outdated; use organization view.
   * peering + cust-prov view should fade.
