## Key Notes

Keynote 1: Anja Feldmann (Deutsche Telekom Labs/TU Berlin, Germany)
Session chair: Volker Hilt (Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent)

mental map of Internet

NAP

IXP. carrier neutral places.
essentially L2 switches.

public peering. private peering.

DE-CIX. 500 members now, 5 locations in Frankfurt

2011, ~350 IXPs worldwide.

collaboration with a major European IXP.
peta bytes per hour.
sFlow. sampling 1 out of 16K. 

quantify the accuracy of the statistics after sampling?

application classification.
limitation of sFlow: 1/16K sample; 128 Bytes data.

IMC'13, using large IXP as vantage points.

organizations having no ASes but many servers can shape the traffic.
end of AS-level view.

peering ratio GT 60%.
this talk 2012, 200K peerings at one single point.

70% peerings are invisible with all pub data sets.

   * Flatter view on IXP than thought.
   * AS view outdated; use organization view.
   * peering + cust-prov view should fade.

## Tailoring End-to-End IP Security Protocols to the Internet of Things

Rene Hummen

Prior:

   * minimal DTLS
   * HIP Diet Exchange (DEX)
   * Minimal IKEv2

pub-key operation overhead too high.

never close sessions: pub-key once.

session resumption.
for HIP DEX protocol.

challenges of pub-key in IoT scenario.

> First, public- key operations require significant resources from a constrained device. Hence, a full handshake should only be performed infrequently. Second, expensive public-key-based operations aggravate the risk of DoS attacks against constrained devices, even with a single, unconstrained adversary. Thus, DoS pro- tection mechanisms for the IoT must account for resource heterogeneity. Third, retransmission strategies have to account for both, varying processing times of handshake messages and high packet loss in constrained wireless networks.

address DoS: responder uses a window; 
under threshold, simple puzzle; 
above threshold, difficult puzzle.

## A Few Bits Are Enough - ASIC Friendly Regular Expression Matching for High Speed Network Security Systems

Alex X. Liu

Deep Packet Inspection

past: string matching.

current: RegEx.
e.g. SNORT

prior works:

   * DFA: best speed, worst memory (can be exponential).
   * NFA, reverse.
   * XFA. 
   associate a piece of programm with each state.
   balance. not practical, esp. for ASIC.

HASIC. History-based FA.

only three instructions: test, set, clear

HFA: DFA+a vector of bits.

bit vector compactly represent partial matches.

## Who are You Talking to? Breaching Privacy in Encrypted IM Networks

Alex X. Liu

arch: everyone talks with IM relay server.

misconception: only server knows content and links.

link privacy revealed without server's help.

input: passively observed traffic; IP of a user 

output: top-k users the given user communicate

1st work for breaking IM communication privacy.

wavelet. COLD.
computes the correlation between wavelet coefficients.

size v.s. time. discrete wavelet. 
Haar wv func.
C&W Shannon based method to choose decomposition levels.

Yahoo Messenger.

future: relation to the WWW2012 information transfer paper?
"Information Transfer in Social Media".
All only use time sequence information.

future: use some smoother for two sequences before calculating correlation.
same effect as spectrum analysis and then use the low-frequency component.

Time Sequence Correlation (TSC) does not work:
randomly delay at relay server.

## GenePrint: Generic and Accurate Physical-Layer IdentiÔ¨Åcation for UHF RFID Tags

Dan Ma

what they hold. what they are.

imperfections in HW, fingerprint.

state-of-the-art: MobiCom2010, D. Zanetti. TIE

Zanetti, Davide, and Boris Danev. "Physical-layer identification of UHF RFID tags." Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking. ACM, 2010. APA 

P=C+f+n

   * C: constant
   * f: feature
   * n: noise

cov(P1,P2)=cov(f1,f2)

RN16

64-pulses: each pair a feature. F.

Equi-width histogram to estimate F's distribution.

future:
use the reader to tap the physical identity of walk-by tags.
without knowing the protocol, we can identify tags.

## Mitigating Malicious Interference via Subcarrier-Level Radio Agility in Wireless Networks

Shailendra Singh

jam attack. easy, commercial software available.

previous, Frequency Hopping, DSS, etc.

exploit OFDM?
