The speaker, 1993, running traffic model for Hongkong.

4 stage model:

   * trip generation: forecasts the source
   * trip distribution: the destination
   * modal split: split among multiple choices.
   * trip assignment

Factors affecting route choice: e.g. time, distance, congestion.

Reasons to choose different route:

   * capacity
   * driver's perception

Wardrop's first principle:
no unilateral increase is possible.

**User Equilibrium (UE)**

Wardrop's second principle:
what best for users may not be the best for the society.
`-->` pursue social optimal.

**Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE)**

Abdel-Aty, 1995, three most important factors:

   * shorter travel time.
   * travel time reliability.
   * ...? (cost?)

Previous models, combine the factors into a single objective.
`-->` single objective.

This:

   * multi-objective `-->` Pareto Efficient.
   * Supported efficient solution: exclude others by a convex hull.
   * Single-objective is actually optimizing a line supported on supported efficient solutions.
   Many Pareto Efficient solution is missing.
   Many groups study the value of time.
   * Equilibrium:
   no unilateral strategy change can improve one objective
   without worsening other objectives.

**Time surplus** conecpt:

   * surplus: extra, remaining.
   * convex, concave utility.

Example:

   * TUE is the combined region of BUE.
   T: Tri-objective.
   B: Bi-objective.
   * `$ UE \subset BUE \subset TUE \subset \Omega $`
