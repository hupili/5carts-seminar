Experience mining from blogs.

One motivation: ask your friend for a problem;
they may have met it and solved it.

Experience: something have been done, not to be done.

Talk title: Building User Knowledge Graph Based on Human Behavioral Data
```

User oriented knowledge graph.
Ego-network by merging multiple platforms.
MS's own data, e.g. Skype;
Public data from Facebook, Twitter, Weibo;
...

Try to link users from different networks:
structural; profile; self-disclosure.

LifeSpec project:
Get data from different social networks.
Jiepang, Weibo, Douban, Dianping.
1.4 million unique users;
53 million footprints (check-in, movie, ...);
3 million social links.

self-disclosure:

   * "Cross-domain" posting.
   * Profile containing links of other social networks.
   * Able to link 1.4 million users.

User linking and graph privacy:

   * Anonymized Graph: target.
   * Auxiliary graph.
   * De-anonymized social graph.
   * Approach 1: measure node similarity.
   Recursive definition using neighbour's similarity.
   * Approach 2: other side information, 
   e.g. node-level attribute, communication.

Location prediction.
User check-ins.
Markov Model.
