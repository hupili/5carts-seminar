### Brief Introduction to the new CUHK Big Data Decision Analytics Research Center Crowdsourcing for Speech and Language Processing

蒙美玲

crowd, dating back to 1800.
Oxford English Dictionary.

"the wisdom of crowd", James. result even better than experts.

amazon MT, taskcn

survey 47 papers, crowdsourcing is mostly used in speech.

Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training.
deployed in CUHK. many courses use it.
Enunciate.
IPA.

classification of mispronunciations. salient error.
crowdsource the rate.
WorkerRank, categorize raters, graph based model.
400K data from 400 workers in one summer, on Amazon MT.
HIT.
copper's weighted kappa.

help treating disordered speech

important problems in crowdsourcing:

   * quality control.
   compare with expert, or detect from crowdsourced data.

## Linear Convergence of the Proximal Gradient Method for Trace Norm Regularization

Anthony So

machine learning:
find a simple structure to well explain observed data.

matrix completion.
Ax=b. low-rank.
loss function, e.g. least square.
nuclear norm, trace norm, approx. for rank function.

traditional method slow, polytime algo. because of inverse.
too slow for big data.
motivates first-order algorithm.
proximity operator.
matrix norm, can get closed form proximity operator,
[Ma'11].

Nesterov'04. sublinear convergence in general.

machine learning, structured problem.
f(x)=h(Ax).
e.g. least square and logistic.
bound the distance by the norm of residual.

solves open problem of Tseng'10.

recent polytime algo. to solve local optima
of Lp, where p between 0 and 1.
when p approaches 0, unstable.

most previous works on convex approximation:
not to consider how close are the two solutions;
but to consider under what scenarios the two problems are equivalent.

## Time-Optimal Interpolation for CNC Machining

5个轴：xyz+两转动轴。

CAD, CAM, CNC interpolation.

问题：满足误差要求，加工时间最短。

feedrate planning.

confined jerk, 
leads to reducing vibration.

## Sampling Theory on Large Graphs: Theory and Applications

John Lui.

data availability. 
dynamic.

RW has same property as ES.

homophily.
nodes connected to other similar nodes.
1-hop, 2-hop, who are more similar.

proximity.

whole set of edges (node pairs).
1-hop subset.
2-hop subset.

want to measure **node pair property**.

1%, can get unbiased result.
(compare with Doerr Aug 2013, > 60% or so to get good estimate of properties)
