## Azure Resources

Bei Li

Academic pass.

Windows Azure Academic Program

faculty: 200 accounts for students in a batch.

propose courses. books, free as soft and hard copyies.

contests.
collaboration with IEEE.
sponsered for conference travel.

## Scale-up Mobile Sensing

Chieh-Jan (Mike) Liang

ubiquitous sensing.

### Phone to Phone gaming

published on MobiSys and SenSys.

e.g. Use the phone as the sword.

e.g. Ping Pong.

HLPP: High-speed, Locational, Phone-to-Phone.

Gesture recognition.

BeepBeep:

   * use sound to measure the distance.
   * multiple receivers. Get the angle.

### Mood Sense

local sensing and analysis.

25 users in Beijing.
Give them a phone and log.
An app ask them how they are feeling now.
(similar to the Huawei Arc's demo)

single model:

   * Discriminative power of data to infer people's mood.
   Location accounts for 60%.
   * Overall accuracy is 61%.

one user per model:

   * Phone calls become a dominant factor.

### MeshNet

Help data center management.

30% of energy goes to operations.

Deploy many sensor nodes, e.g. humidity, temperature, air, RF, etc.

Sensor node.
ZigBee Radio node
(multi-hop mesh network).

Goal 1: minimize interference.

Approach: tree-based token-pass.

Traffic prioritization.
Idea: reflect prioritization using transmission power.

Use: prediction, e.g. the hotspot.

### City-wide Vehicular Safety

e.g. emergency brake of the car in the front.
e.g. road condition collaborative report.

802.11p. IEEE, VANET

802.11p is not here but phone is ready.

OBD-II (?).

### Music selection according to heartbeats

Put an earphone which produces music and also listens to your pulse.

heartbeats reflect mood.
e.g. tense or not.
